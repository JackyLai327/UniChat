# ``UniChat``

“I don’t know what courses are good!” “I hope this class gives me a good lecturer.” Voices like these always happen when enrolment periods are around the corner every semester. On social media sites like Discord and Reddit people come up with discussions like these to choose their desired classes. It is udenialble to say that there is not really a place for Australian university students to discuss their universities, lecturers and studies. UniChat is here to solve exactly this problem. On UniChat, university students are allowed to rate their universities and lecturers while having discussions about their courses with their peers anonymously. For anyone who is joining or studying at universities with heaps of confusion and doesn’t know where to start, UniChat is their best place to shoot their questions and consult their peers and seniors.

## Overview

With UniChat, Australian university students will be able to discuss their courses/units while having the freedom to rate a lecturer. Some main features include:

- Discussions: The main feature of UniChat, is there to provide a safe and confidential space for students to discuss about their universities and lecturers.
- Anonymity and authenticity: UniChat requires all users to provide their proof of enrolment to post discussions as verified students or alumni. A user shall not be allowed to post a discussion on certain universities and lectures without human-verification for those corresponding universities to protect all universities’ and lectures’ reputatoin. All users are allowed to “join a discussion,” presenting as comments, if they have at least one verified university. 
- Ratings: Verified students are also allowed to rate their universities and lectures with pre-selected criterias. Ratings can serve as an indicator for students to enrol with a better idea, for parents to trust their children’s decisions and for universities and lectures to perform up to standards and expectations.
- Multi-Uni verification: A student is permitted to post discussions on multiple universities and/or lecturers as long as they can provide proof of enrolment for all requested universities. This unique feature is for students who have enroled in different universities with different degrees and programs.

Having these features UniChat provides, students and parents can feel less stressed out and overwhelmed while choosing the best option regarding universities and courses, and the authorities can also monitor universities and lecturers regarding the education environments through the real voices of students.
