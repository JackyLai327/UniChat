On social media sites like Discord and Reddit people come up with discussions like these to choose their desired classes. It is udenialble to say that there is not really a place for Australian university students to discuss their universities, lecturers and studies. UniChat is here to solve exactly this problem. On UniChat, university students are allowed to rate their universities and lecturers while having discussions about their courses with their peers anonymously. For anyone who is joining or studying at universities with heaps of confusion and doesn’t know where to start, UniChat is their best place to shoot their questions and consult their peers and seniors."}],"identifier":"doc:\/\/None.UniChat\/documentation\/UniChat","kind":"symbol","type":"topic","url":"\/documentation\/unichat"},"doc://None.UniChat/documentation/UniChat/CameraView/UIViewControllerType":{"role":"symbol","title":"CameraView.UIViewControllerType","fragments":[{"kind":"keyword","text":"typealias"},{"kind":"text","text":" "},{"kind":"identifier","text":"UIViewControllerType"}],"abstract":[],"identifier":"doc:\/\/None.UniChat\/documentation\/UniChat\/CameraView\/UIViewControllerType","kind":"symbol","type":"topic","navigatorTitle":[{"kind":"identifier","text":"UIViewControllerType"}],"url":"\/documentation\/unichat\/cameraview\/uiviewcontrollertype"}}}
